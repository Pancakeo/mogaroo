#summary Brief instructions for executing the jar. Intended for students and not-really-all-that-tech-savvy-people

= Steps =

Download a myuw-cli JAR from the Downloads page.
 * Open a terminal window. (Windows users: Command Prompt)
 * Navigate to the folder you put the JAR in.
 * Execute: java -jar <jar name>
 * You'll be prompted to enter various commands.

Note: Most commands require you to login, which can be done using the login command.

A few examples:
 # monitorsection -d MATH -l 390 -s A -q winter -y 2012
 # login -u george -p 1234
 # register -q winter -y 2012 -sln 12345
 # getcourses -q winter -y 2012
 # drop -q winter -y 2012 -sln 12345

Eventually, a GUI might be made.  Just in time for Christmas.

Earlier, we saw an error message with the test account while trying to register for multiple courses. Fortunately, this occurred after most of the testing was complete.

Here was the error message:

We're not quite sure how many register / drop operations we did before we hit this condition. We believe it was somewhere around 50.

While this is an edge case of unusual behavior, we thought it was better to let you know that excessive register / drop operations have consequences.
